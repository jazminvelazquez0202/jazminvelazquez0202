	<h1>Hello World!</h1>


	<h2>A place I would like to visit</h2>
	
		<p>If I could visit anywhere in the world it would be Paris.I would love to visit the rich culture and the beautiful art located at all places.I 
		would love to see the beautiful vintage stores and see the city lights. Im sure their food would be great along with the people and the great artistic pices. </p>
	
	<h2>A person I admire (past or present)</h2>
	
		<p>A person I admire my grandma, I admire her because she's a strong person but most of all she's a strong mother who had to work as a single mother of six kids 
		having no help from a man. She raised six beautiful and kind children all on her own and I'm pretty sure that could have not been simple. </p>
